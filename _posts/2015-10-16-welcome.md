I am Cameron Trow, an autistic <a href="http://nintendo.co.uk">Nintendo</a> enthusiast that is obsessed with computers. I am currently studying in <a href="http://thestudio-liverpool.co.uk" target="_blank">The Studio</a>.  I mainly want to apply for jobs related to computers because the *industry is heading towards using computer related stuff such as robots and automated stuff. I am on the autism spectrum as ADHD and I also approach life in a different angle.
