I am Cameron Trow, an autistic Nintendo enthusiast that is obsessed with computers. I am currently studying in The Studio.  I mainly want to apply for jobs related to computers because the *industry is heading towards using computer related stuff such as robots and automated stuff. I am on the autism spectrum as ADHD and I also approach life in a different angle.
